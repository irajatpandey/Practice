1. Beautiful Tree

You are given a tree, rooted at 1, with N vertices (indexed from 1 to N). Each vertex has a value associated with it. The value of ith vertex is ai. Consider fi as the aith beautiful number. A beautiful number is a positive number, whose sum of the square of its digits is less than or equal to X. You have to process M queries, where each query can be



1 i y - Update ai = y

2 i    - Output the sum of fi for all the nodes in the sub-tree of node i (including node i), since the output can be very large, answer it modulo 998244353

See sample test case for more clarification


Note: Partial Points are present

Constraints



1 <= N, M, i, ui, vi, ai, y <= 5*105

1 <= X <= 1010
