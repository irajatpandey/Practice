3. ZaurXor

You are given an array of integers A of size N. You perform a certain operation K times on the array A, modifying the array with every operation. The operation is to replace the array A with a new array, which is the XOR of the adjacent elements of A, and of length size(A)-1.

You are given an index M, the value of this index in array A after K operations is to be found.


Note: Partial points are present


Constraints

1 <= N <= 1e5

1 < K < N

0 <= M < N-K

1 <= A[i] <= 1e9

Input:
3
1
0
4 5 6

Output: 1

Explanation

Original Array => 4 5 6

Operation 1 => 1 3 (4 XOR 5 = 1, 5 XOR 6 = 3)

M is 0, so after 1 operation, A[0] = 1

TestCase2:
4
2
1
1 2 3 4

Output: 6

Original Array => 1 2 3 4

Operation 1 => 3 1 7 (1 XOR 2 = 3, 2 XOR 3 = 1, 3 XOR 4 = 7)

Operation 2 => 2 6 (3 XOR 1 = 2, 1 XOR 7 = 6)

M is 1, so after 2 operations, A[1] = 6
